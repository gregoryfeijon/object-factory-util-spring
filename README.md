# object-factory-util-spring
Project with use case example of my class **ObjectFactoryUtil**, that can be useful to create a completely new object from another one with the same type (with new object references, even for Lists, Maps and others wrapper types). Implementation created specially to Spring projects.

Here's an implementation to use in non Spring projects:
